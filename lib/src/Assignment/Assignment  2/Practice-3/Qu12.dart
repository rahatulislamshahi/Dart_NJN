//Write a function in Dart called calculateArea that calculates the area of a rectangle. It should take length and width as arguments, with a default value of 1 for both. Formula: length * width.

double calculateArea({double length = 1, double width = 1}) {
  return length * width;
}

void main() {
  print("Area: ${calculateArea(length: 5, width: 3)}");
  print("Area with defaults: ${calculateArea()}");
